    <h1>Using the HR (Horizontal Rule) Tag in HTML</h1>

    <!-- The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line to separate sections of content. It's used to visually separate content. -->
    <p>This is the first section of content.</p>
    
    <!-- Horizontal Rule: A simple line dividing sections -->
    <hr>

    <p>This is the second section of content, after the horizontal rule.</p>
    
    <!-- Horizontal Rule with Additional Styling: We can also use CSS to style the <hr> element (color, width, height, etc.) -->
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 80%; margin-top: 20px;">

    <p>This is a third section, after a styled horizontal rule.</p>

    <!-- Notes:
         - <hr> is a self-closing tag (no need for a closing tag).
         - By default, <hr> is displayed as a horizontal line.
         - It's useful for creating visual breaks between sections of content, like chapters, sections of a page, etc.
         - We can style it with CSS for more customization (like color, thickness, width, etc.).
