    <h1>Using the BR (Break) Tag in HTML</h1>

    <!-- The <br> tag is used to insert a line break, which makes the following content to appear on the next line -->
    <p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line, after a line break.</p>

    <!-- Example of multiple line breaks for spacing -->
    <p>This is some text with <br><br>two line breaks between it.</p>

    <!-- Important Notes:
         - The <br> tag is a self-closing tag, so no need for a closing tag.
         - Itâ€™s used to add the line breaks.
    -->
